## AirPredict AQI Prediction Using Classification Algorithms
### Introduction to Air Quality

Air quality refers to the condition of the air within our environment, which directly impacts the health and well-being of all living organisms. It is a critical aspect of environmental health, as poor air quality can lead to various adverse health effects, including respiratory diseases, cardiovascular problems, and even premature death. The quality of the air is determined by the concentration of pollutants, including particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), ammonia (NH3), ozone (O3), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like benzene, toluene, and xylene.

The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a standardized indicator used globally to communicate the level of air pollution. It converts complex air quality data into a single number, color, or descriptor, making it easier for the public to understand how polluted the air currently is or how polluted it is forecasted to become. Monitoring air quality and managing pollutants are essential for reducing the health risks associated with poor air quality and for ensuring a healthy environment for future generations.

In recent years, rapid industrialization, urbanization, and the increase in vehicular emissions have significantly deteriorated air quality, especially in urban areas. This has led to a growing concern about the need for effective air quality management and mitigation strategies. Understanding and predicting air quality trends through data analysis and machine learning has become a vital tool in addressing these challenges, enabling proactive measures to improve the air we breathe.

## Description

This project aims to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) using various classification algorithms. The AQI is a crucial indicator of air pollution levels and plays a significant role in public health awareness. By analyzing historical air quality data from multiple cities across India, the project develops a predictive model capable of assessing the AQI based on several key pollutants, including PM2.5, PM10, NOx, SO2, CO, NH3, and O3.
